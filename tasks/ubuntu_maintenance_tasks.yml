#Ansible playbook that performs various system cleaning tasks on Ubuntu Linux, including removing unnecessary packages, cleaning the APT cache, removing old kernels, cleaning thumbnail cache, and clearing systemd journal logs:

- name: Clean Ubuntu system
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Remove apt lock file
      file:
        state: absent
        path: "/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend"

    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        cache_valid_time: 3600

    - name: Remove unnecessary packages
      apt:
        autoremove: yes

    - name: Clean APT cache
      apt:
        autoclean: yes

    - name: Remove old kernels
      shell: dpkg -l | awk '/linux-image-*/ {print $2}' | grep -v $(uname -r) | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge

    - name: Clean thumbnail cache
      file:
        path: ~/.cache/thumbnails
        state: absent
      become_user: "{{ ansible_user }}"
      when: ansible_user_dir is defined

    - name: Clear systemd journal logs
      systemd:
        name: systemd-journald
        state: restarted

    - name: Schedule a reboot
      reboot:
        reboot_timeout: 600
        msg: "Reboot initiated by Ansible. The system will reboot in 1 minute."
      async: 0
      poll: 0
      ignore_errors: yes

#This playbook will perform the following tasks:

#1. Update the APT cache to ensure the package information is up-to-date.
#2. Remove unnecessary packages using apt autoremove.
#3. Clean the APT cache using apt autoclean.
#4. Remove old kernels to free up disk space (This is optional, and you should consider the implications of removing old kernels).
#5. Remove the thumbnail cache for the current user (if applicable).
#6. Clear systemd journal logs to free up disk space.
#7. Schedule a reboot with a timeout of 600 seconds (10 minutes) and display a message indicating the reboot has been initiated by Ansible. The async, poll, and ignore_errors options are used to avoid the playbook from waiting for the reboot to complete.
